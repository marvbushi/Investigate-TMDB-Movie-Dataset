# Investigate-TMDB-Movie-Dataset
The objective of this project was to get some insights about the TMDB Movies Dataset.
As a result of this research:
*	Created a write up report of the findings
*	Visualized the findings for easy understandings
*	Found out that movies popularity is growing since 1960. 
*	Movies with the higher popularity were related with those that obtained the highest revenue.
*	Found out the top five director, top five cast members, and best months for releasing a movie.

**During the research encounter some limitations with the dataset:**
*	Found multiples columns with data missing or not specified. About 50% of the data was not specified. That data was removed from dataset reducing it from 10865 to 3489 rows. By removing that data, it may have affected the outcome of the research and increased the margin error due the lack of information in the dataset.
*	Currency was not specified. This may have affected the result because movies could have a different budget and revenue according to the country it was produced and released in.
*	By performing dimensionality reduction techniques, on the original data and the reduced dataset the margin of error could be found. The outcome of this analysis can be refined with obtainability of the missing information and some statistical testing.
